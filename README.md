# EML Plugins
This repository contains plugins developed by [UBC Emerging Media Lab](https://eml.ubc.ca) and instructions on how to install them.

All projects developed at the EML are required to use the core plugins if the platform allows it.
The plugins will be developed continually and maintained. All features and how to use them will be listed in the separate 'Features' sections.

Feature requests and other suggestions are welcome. Contact us at emergingmedia.lab@ubc.ca.
